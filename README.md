# System-Programming
This repository shows my work for NTU course, *System Programming*. All of them is implemented in C language.
* Vaccination Registeration: 
  * Clients will enter their preferred order of 3 types of vaccination, and all I have to do is to record what they typed in.
  * This system also supports multiple clients to connect.
* Chiffon cake game
  * It is somehow the game of guessing number.
  * Since it have several rounds and levels of game, I implements it with FIFO and pipe to communicate with different process.
* Thread & Jump
  * This project simply implements the function of **long jump** in C language.
* Multi-thread
  * This project shows how to apply multi-thread approach to reduce the execution time.
